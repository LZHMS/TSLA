## Introduction
This is an excellent paper of mathematical modeling research with the honour of **_National Second Prize_**.

## Project Started
1. Clone `TLSA`
```git
git clone https://github.com/LZHMS/TSLA.git
```
2. Configure the environment of `Jupyter Notebook`

## Project Structure
+ The codes of `P1.ipynb` mainly focus on the big data processing of the paper and you can easily run the codes to get the results. Also I have uploaded the all processed data files under the `data` folder.
+ The codes of `P2-P3.ipynb` mainly focus on the mathematical modeling of the paper. Especailly, how this model can be used to predict the future saling patterns of vegetable prices and varieties in order to develop the best ordering strategy.
